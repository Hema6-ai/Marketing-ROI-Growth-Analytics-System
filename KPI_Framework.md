KPI Framework — Marketing ROI & Growth Analytics System
1. Purpose of the KPI Framework

This KPI framework defines how marketing performance is measured, what success means, and how decisions are driven.

Each KPI directly answers a business question related to:

Growth

Profitability

Efficiency

Risk

Budget optimization

No vanity metrics. Only decision-grade KPIs.

The KPIs are organized into five logical layers:

Investment & Cost Efficiency

Return & Profitability

Growth Effectiveness

Risk & Stability

Decision Signals (Action-Oriented KPIs)

3. Investment & Cost Efficiency KPIs
3.1 Acquisition Cost

Definition
Total cost incurred to acquire customers through a campaign or channel.

Metric

Acquisition_Cost

Why It Matters
High spend without proportional return signals budget leakage.

3.2 Cost per Engagement (Derived)

Definition
Cost incurred per engagement action.

Formula

Acquisition_Cost / Engagement_Score


Business Question Answered
Are we paying too much for customer attention?

Definition
Revenue efficiency of marketing spend.

Metric

ROI

Purpose
Enables comparison of channels on a normalized scale.

5. Growth Effectiveness KPIs
5.1 Conversion Rate

Definition
Percentage of users converting after exposure.

Metric

Business Question Answered
Which channels actually drive customer action?

6. Risk & Stability KPIs
6.1 ROI Volatility

Definition
Standard deviation of ROI per channel.

Formula

STD(ROI)


Business Question Answered
