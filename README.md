# Marketing ROI & Growth Analytics System

## Project Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign data to determine **where marketing money is working, where it is being wasted, why it is happening, and what actions should be taken to improve growth and profitability**.

The analysis is designed to mirror **real-world business analytics**, not academic exercises. Every step ties marketing activity directly to **ROI, risk, and decision-making**.

---

## Business Objective

Marketing teams often scale spend based on impressions, clicks, or engagement. This project challenges that approach by answering one core question:

> **Which marketing investments actually generate profitable, sustainable growth?**

---

## Key Questions Answered

1. Which channels generate the highest ROI?
2. Which channels consume high budget but underperform?
3. Are high-ROI channels stable or risky?
4. Does engagement reliably convert into profit?
5. What actions should leadership take to improve returns?

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains campaign-level marketing data, including:

* Channel used
* Marketing spend
* Revenue generated
* ROI
* Conversion rate
* Engagement score
* Campaign duration

Derived metrics include:

* ROI volatility (risk)
* Cost efficiency indicators
* Channel-level performance aggregates

---

## KPI Framework

Primary KPIs:

* **Return on Investment (ROI)** – Core profitability metric
* **Total Spend** – Capital allocation visibility
* **Conversion Rate** – Funnel effectiveness
* **ROI Volatility** – Risk and stability indicator

Secondary KPIs:

* Engagement score
* Revenue contribution per channel



## Analysis Workflow

1. Data cleaning and validation
2. ROI and efficiency calculations
3. Channel-level aggregation
4. Risk (volatility) assessment
5. Identification of budget leakage
6. Strategic recommendation generation

---

## Key Insights

* A small number of channels drive the majority of profitable returns
* High engagement does not always translate to high ROI
* Budget wastage is concentrated in specific channels
* Stable ROI channels outperform volatile ones over time

---

## Recommendations

* Scale high-ROI, low-risk channels
* Reduce or pause low-ROI, high-spend campaigns
* Introduce ROI-based performance thresholds
* Shift KPI focus from engagement to profitability

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* SQL (CTEs, aggregations, performance analysis)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau (for dashboards)

---

## Project Outcome

This project delivers a **decision-ready marketing performance framework** that enables:

* Smarter budget allocation
* Reduced marketing waste
* Improved ROI
* Sustainable growth planning
